### Discussions at the Meeting

- **Dashboards – First Version Landed** ([Issue #86](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/86)):
  - [@GroophyLifefor](https://github.com/GroophyLifefor) and team successfully landed the first version of the performance dashboard ([PR #73](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/pull/73))
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) noted this is just the beginning and a to-do list of next steps needs to be established
  - Discussion centered on further dashboard improvements and what features/content are priority

- **Dashboard Artifacts & Storage Challenge** ([Issue #84](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/84)):
  - [@GroophyLifefor](https://github.com/GroophyLifefor) highlighted that benchmark result artifacts are currently not accessible from the UI due to GitHub artifacts access restrictions requiring authentication
  - Problem: GitHub artifact storage requires signing, and nav account tokens cannot be used in a browser environment
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) proposed two potential solutions:
    1. **Move results to permanent storage**: Take result files out of GitHub artifacts and store them in a more permanent location
    2. **Commit results on release**: For benchmarks that go with Express releases, commit the result file directly into the repository as part of the release commit (alongside changelog and version changes)
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) advocated for the second approach to enable historical analysis and easy rollback to performance data from specific release points

- **Open Pull Requests Discussion**:
  - Two PRs were highlighted for review and discussion this meeting
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) mentioned specific changes in [PR #87](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/pull/87) that need community feedback

- **Express 4 vs Express 5 Performance Discussion**:
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) referenced a Reddit post from r/node discussing Express 4 vs Express 5 performance benchmarks
  - Community interest noted in performance comparisons between major versions
  - Referenced blog post: [Express 4 vs Express 5 Benchmark Node 18-24](https://www.repoflow.io/blog/express-4-vs-express-5-benchmark-node-18-24)

- **Demo Video Recording**:
  - Team discussed recording an official demo and video to showcase the current state of the performance testing process
  - Goal is to use this for outreach to attract new contributors and demonstrate workflow to the community
  - Good timing to publish at the start of the new year to encourage participation
