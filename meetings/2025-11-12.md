# Performance Working Group Meeting Notes – 2025-11-12

### Meta Information

- GitHub Issue: [#67](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/67)

### Discussions at the Meeting

- **Dashboards and APM Integration** ([Issue #28](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/28)):
  - **NodeSource APM Integration**:
    - Using built-in dashboarding from APM partners for initial implementation
  
  - **Partnership with Multiple APM Vendors**:
    - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) talked at JSConf in October with potential partners
    - Goal is to partner with New Relic, Datadog, and Sentry in addition to NodeSource
    - Important for long-term sustainability since Express is underfunded and relies on volunteers
    - STA funding exists to get performance monitoring across the finish line this year
    - After initial funding, project needs APM vendor partnerships to maintain infrastructure without dedicated resources
  
  - **Dashboard Development Work**:
    - Need to output standard format from APM integrations to build static dashboard
    - Dashboard should compare CI integration results with baseline (latest Express version)
    - [@groophylifefor](https://github.com/groophylifefor) volunteered to work on front-end webpage for comparing data
    - First iteration doesn't need complex graphs, just clear comparison of metrics showing improvement or regression
    - Need to define standard output format

- **CI Integration Technical Plan**:
  - Talked about technical plan for getting CI integration done by end of year
  - Goal is to run performance tests on-demand for PRs and compare against baseline
  - Results will be shown in PRs in a clear format
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) shared issue #67 in chat for technical plan details

- **Benchmarking References**:
  - [@rafaelgss](https://github.com/rafaelgss) shared Fastify benchmark examples:
    - Fastify benchmarks workflow: https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks/blob/main/.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml
    - Fastify PR benchmark workflow: https://github.com/RafaelGSS/fastify/blob/8cd2340c24fcc1802665c43546147dd067c6e9e4/.github/workflows/benchmark.yml
  - [@ulisesgascon](https://github.com/ulisesgascon) expressed support (+60 in chat)

- **Data Format Discussion**:
  - [@groophylifefor](https://github.com/groophylifefor) asked about sample data format for comparison work
  - Talked about whether browsers can handle large JSON files for dashboard
  - Need to set up a standard output format from performance testing tools
