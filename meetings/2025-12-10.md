# Performance Working Group Meeting Notes – 2025-12-10

### Meta Information

- GitHub Issue: [#<number>](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/<number>)


### Discussions at the Meeting

- **Dashboard Demo**
  - [@GroophyLifefor](https://github.com/GroophyLifefor) presented the progress on the performance dashboard.
  - The JSON output was optimized by removing unnecessary data to reduce file size.
  - The dashboard architecture involves fetching baseline JSON and comparing it with current results.
  - Flamegraphs are generated as SVGs and handled in the client for comparison.
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) provided positive feedback and suggested moving to code review.

- **CI Integration and Data Format**
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) discussed the CI integration Pull Request.
  - A change was introduced to make client results an array, which affects how the dashboard consumes data.
  - There was a discussion on whether to include multiple request formats (e.g., root `/` vs `/foo`) in the benchmarks.
  - If the array format is retained, the dashboard and result files will need to be updated to handle it.
  - [@GroophyLifefor](https://github.com/GroophyLifefor) mentioned he might back out the change to simplify the merge or proceed with the necessary updates.

- **Standard Deviation Metrics**
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) raised a question about how standard deviation changes are visualized (e.g., whether a decrease is marked as "improved").
  - [@GroophyLifefor](https://github.com/GroophyLifefor) explained the current implementation and agreed to adjust the logic based on feedback during the review.
