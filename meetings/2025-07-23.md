# Performance Working Group Meeting Notes â€“ 2025-07-23

### Meta Information

- GitHub Issue: [#27](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/27)

### Discussions at the Meeting

- @muratkirazkaya presented [expf](https://github.com/GroophyLifefor/expf) that a **Docker image for performance testing runner**:

  - Compares **latest NPM package** vs. **candidate source code** to detect regressions.
  - Supports custom templates (e.g., Autocannon), multiple node versions parallelly and multiple test folders.
  - Built to run on **GitHub Actions** and locally via Docker, enabling reproducible tests across platforms.
  - Murat emphasized that the tool benchmarks **Express against itself**, rather than other frameworks.

- **Noted**: The runner (expf) will be tested on Windows environments to ensure cross-platform functionality.
  - Current CI uses Ubuntu runners, but the Docker image is portable and expected to work on Windows and macOS as well.
- @ulisesgascon shared that a **Docker Hub org** is ready for CI-based image publishing.

  - While team access is limited, publishing will rely on automation using CI secrets or tokens.

- **Issue #3 (Recurring Meetings)**:

  - Decided to remove from active agenda; regular meetings are now established.

- **Issue #27 (Public Benchmarks)**:

  - Proposal to maintain/update public benchmark repositories testing Express performance.
  - Jon noted itâ€™s a low-priority item unless someone volunteers, but the group can offer guidance to contributors.
  - Murat clarified that while **cross-framework benchmarks are not dismissed**, the current focus is on **internal regressions** to ensure Express maintains or improves its own performance over time.

- **Reference Application Strategy**:

  - @jonchurch suggested using **real-world Express apps** to benchmark performance across Express versions.
  - @kjugi opened an issue to define the types of apps the group should support.
  - The goal is to test performance of different Express versions under realistic usage patterns.

- **Issue #29 (Dashboard Integration)**:
  - @edsadr (NodeSource) offered an **open-source React-based dashboard**.
    - Feeds on JSON data and can be tailored to WG requirements.
  - WG needs to define what **metrics and views** should be supported.
  - Murat emphasized that dashboarding is an **active priority**, and contributor support is welcome.
