# Performance Working Group Meeting Notes â€“ 2025-07-09

### Meta Information

- GitHub Issue: [#25](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/25)


### Discussions at the Meeting

- The **Working Group Charter** was merged ([#26](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/pull/26)) after discussion; agreed it's a starting point for future updates.
- Adrian Estrada suggested **heap profiles instead of heap snapshots.**
- @wesleytodd demoed the **benchmarking tooling** using Docker, autocannon, and flamegraphs. It supports comparing across Node versions and collecting detailed result JSONs.
- @bjohansebas proposed using **WIBY** for future work involving package overrides in benchmarks.
- @ulisesgascon (Docker Captain) offered to help with higher Docker Hub tiers if needed. He and Adrian Estrada recommended using **Docker Hub** to host benchmark images for cloud testing.
- @muratkirazkaya suggested using **Dagger** to make container configurations cleaner and code-driven.
- Discussion on creating a **dashboard** to visualize benchmark results and system metrics. NodeSource may contribute a base version of their internal dashboard.
- Importance of defining **resource boundaries** (e.g., memory, CPU, architecture) for consistent benchmarking was noted.
