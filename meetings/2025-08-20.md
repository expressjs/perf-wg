# Performance Working Group Meeting Notes â€“ 2025-08-20

### Meta Information

- GitHub Issue: [#42](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/42)

### Discussions at the Meeting

- **Meeting Date Issue Resolution**:
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) fixed a date error in the agenda that incorrectly showed "tomorrow" instead of the current meeting date. Quick fix was implemented via [PR #46](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/pull/46) to correct the schedule

- **What Kind of Apps Should We Test** ([Issue #34](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/34)):
  - [@jonchurch](https://github.com/jonchurch) proposed a **Tier 1 and Tier 2 testing approach**:
    - **Tier 1**: Focused unit suites and micro-benchmarks targeting specific subsystems (e.g., 5,000 deeply nested routes to stress-test routing)
    - **Tier 2**: Integration-level testing with real-world applications like the To-Do app to see aggregate performance changes
    - Goal is to provide actionable reports that can isolate performance changes to specific subsystems
  
  - [@kjugi](https://github.com/kjugi) referenced his previous proposals for test applications including:
    - Simple crud application with authorization
    - Three additional application types that could be merged or implemented separately
    - Offered to implement one of the applications from his list when time permits
  
  - **Decision to use multiple static fixture apps** rather than configurable applications:
    - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) emphasized that static fixtures are easier to compare and debug
    - Configuration-based apps make comparison more complex and error-prone
    - Individual packages approach aligns with the recent server refactor

- **Server Refactor and Infrastructure Updates**:
  - [@wesleytodd](https://github.com/wesleytodd) completed a refactor moving servers to individual packages to support npm overrides feature
  - Docker container issues mentioned by [@jonchurch](https://github.com/jonchurch) are addressed in the pending PR
  - Discussion on handling API surface changes when comparing across Express major versions

- **Performance Testing Tooling Proposals**:
  - [@groophylifefor](https://github.com/groophylifefor) shared proposal for performance tests published in Docker image
    - Reference: [body-parser PR #1 (example result)](https://github.com/GroophyLifefor/body-parser/pull/1) and [proposal issue #38](https://github.com/expressjs/perf-wg/issues/38)
  - [@riosje](https://github.com/riosje) suggested that performance testing tooling should include environment variable support

- **External Framework Updates**:
  - [@bjohansebas](https://github.com/bjohansebas) mentioned opening PRs to update Express in Bluesky but noted review delays because several maintainers of Blueksy are on vacation - [ref](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/pull/4046)
  - [@jonchurch](https://github.com/jonchurch) referenced [Pelias](https://github.com/pelias/pelias) as another potential real-world application for testing
